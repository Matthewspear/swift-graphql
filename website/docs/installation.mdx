## Installation

SwiftGraphQL is a code generator as well as a GraphQL client. That's why it's important that you install both of them.

Make sure Xcode 11+ is installed first. Then, you need to include the client in your iOS/macOS project, and locally generate the code using code generator.

### Installing SwiftGraphQL Client

To install it using Swift Package Manager, open the following menu item in Xcode:

File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...

In the Choose Package Repository prompt add this url:

```
https://github.com/maticzav/swift-graphql/
```

Then press Next and complete the remaining steps. You should select `SwiftGraphQL` as a dependency, since that includes the client code.

To learn more about Swift Package Manager, check out the [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app).

### Installing Code Generator

SwiftGraphQL generator comes as a CLI tool and as a library that you may import. You can use Mint, Homebrew and Make to use CLI only, or you may import it as a SPM dependency and use the generator itself.

#### Mint

```sh
mint install maticzav/swift-graphql
```

> You can read more about Mint [here](https://github.com/yonaskolb/mint).

#### Homebrew

```sh
brew tap maticzav/swift-graphql https://github.com/maticzav/swift-graphql.git
brew install SwiftGraphQL
```

#### Make

```sh
git clone https://github.com/maticzav/swift-graphql.git
cd swift-graphql
make install
```
