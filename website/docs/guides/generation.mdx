SwiftGraphQL comes with a ready to use command line utility that lets you generate code from the schema on a remote or local server.

Additionally, the library exports all the tools you need to fine grain the generation process or use it in a Swift Package.

### Command Line Utility

```
USAGE: swift-graphql <endpoint> [--config <config>] [--output <output>]

ARGUMENTS:
  <endpoint>              GraphQL server endpoint.

OPTIONS:
  --config <config>       Relative path from CWD to your YML config file.
  -o, --output <output>   Relative path from CWD to the output file.
  -h, --help              Show help information.
```

To run the generator, type `swift-graphql`. If you are using any custom scalars, you should create a configuration file called `swiftgraphql.yml` and put in data-type mappings as a key-value dictionary like this. Keys should be GraphQL types, and values should be SwiftGraphQL Codecs.

```yml
scalars:
  Date: DateTime
  Upload: Upload
```

You can also run `swift-graphql --help` to learn more about options and how it works.
