SwiftGraphQL ships with a basic networking client that lets you perform network calls and caches the data.

> For a detailed overview of all client functions examine exposed functions and their comments.

```swift
let client = GraphQLClient()

client.query(Human.query)
	.sink { value in

	}
	.replaceError(nil)
```
